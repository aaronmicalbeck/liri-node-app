# Liri-Node-App

This is a CLI application that utilizes the Spotify npm, OMDB Api, Bands In Town API, and features the Node.js file system module to read a random.txt file to execute a command.

# Usage

This will require your own API keys as well as your own .env file to run the program successfully.

The program will take a command in the terminal.  Specifically:

>spotify-this-song "songname": This will print artist namee, song title, a spotify link to preview, and the album on which it is found.

>concert-this "band or artist name": This will print the venue name, location, and date and time of the band/artist's show.

>movie-this "movie name": This will print the name of the movie,the release year, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes rating, the country,language, plot, and the major actors in the film.

>do-what-it-says: This will read the random.txt file and execute whatever the command is.
